### Friendly and Well-Designed UI

The User Interface is well designed and really easy to use.

### Login and Register

In the login and register page, in addition to checking the input when submitting, it will check the input content immediately after inputting (when text area is unblurred). For invalid inputs, corresponding prompts will be given on the page. And the validity of email address would be checked more strictly using a regex.

### Liking a Job

In addition to liking a work, users can also unlike a work. The like button have different style for like and unlike. It will change depending on whether the user has already liked the work or not. Users will see the button change immediately after clicking it, providing better feedback.

### Updating Profile/Job

The user's or work's original information will be displayed in the input box. If you haven't modified a certain item, a prompt will appear on the page indicating that you haven't changed that item. Like the login and registration pages, your input will be checked immediately after entering, and there will be corresponding prompts displayed.

At the bottom of the page, the currently used image will be displayed, and the image you upload will also be shown there immediately after uploading, allowing you to confirm whether you have uploaded the correct image.

### Not Found Page

For invalid URL, we have designed a not found page, telling the user that the input URL do not exist or you have no permission to access that page.
